# Class Work from Open Source Geospatial Programming 

This repository contains all of my work from Open Source Geospatial Programming. It includes a variety of scripts and projects that demonstrate analysis and processing of raster and vector data using open-source tools. The work shows applications of Python and GIS libraries (such as GDAL, Rasterio, GeoPandas, Geowombat, and Shapely) for geospatial data analysis.
